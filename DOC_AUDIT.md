# Documentation Audit

**Date:** 2026-04-26
**Repo:** /Users/vives/bird-classifier-pi (Pi-side)
**Docs audited:** CLAUDE.md, GUIDE.md, docs/00-overview.md … docs/08-deployment.md, docs/README.md
**Code roots scanned:** bird_pipeline_v3.py, pipeline/ (frame_capture, hires_ring, hailo_engine, hailo_detector, hailo_classifier, model_registry, pi_classifier, process_thread, motion_gate, tracker, snapshot_writer, classifier), dashboard/api.py, dashboard/pi_dash.html, dashboard/pi_review.py, tools/pi5_thermal_watch.py, tools/bench_hailo_multimodel.py, models/, ~/.config/systemd/user/* on pi5.local, runtime state via ssh

## What was reorganised

Beyond claim-level fixes, the full docs/ tree was restructured (Phase 1):

- **CLAUDE.md** — preamble path drift fixed (comms file moved); body rewritten from iMac architecture to Pi architecture (services count, Coral → Hailo NPU + AIY-CPU, two cameras → one, vote-lock now lists the conf threshold, ground-cam removed, references to chapter docs added).
- **GUIDE.md** — full rewrite (was the iMac Reference Guide top to bottom — Docker go2rtc, LaunchAgents, two cameras, Coral USB, defunct `live_detector.py`). Replaced with a chapter index pointing at the new `docs/` tree.
- **9 reference chapters authored** at `docs/00-overview.md` through `docs/08-deployment.md` (Phase 2). 759 lines total.
- **62 docs reorganised** (Phase 1):
  - `docs/superpowers/{plans,specs,progress,reviews}/` flattened into:
    - `docs/working/{plans,specs,progress}/` — 4 active reference docs
    - `docs/historical/{plans,specs,progress,reviews}/` — 60 retired docs, each banner-prepended with the iMac-format `> **HISTORICAL**` line
- **Empty `docs/superpowers/` tree removed.**
- **`docs/README.md` created** as the chapter-index entry point.

**Active doc set after audit:**
- Root: CLAUDE.md, GUIDE.md, DOC_AUDIT.md
- docs/: 9 chapters (00-08) + README.md
- docs/working/: 1 spec (hailo-playbook), 0 plans, 3 progress (pi5-handoff, pi-repo-split, cross-claude-comms)

## ⚠️ Drift (auto-fixed)

### 1. BOOT_ORDER value wrong in 01-hardware.md

- **Doc:** `docs/01-hardware.md:25` (chapter draft)
- **Original claim:** `BOOT_ORDER = 0xf41`
- **Code reality:** Pi reports `BOOT_ORDER=0xf14` via `vcgencmd bootloader_config` — USB-MSD-first hex order. (The iMac head-start doc `~/docs/bird-observatory/historical/34-pi5-migration.md:40` had the wrong nybble order; my chapter inherited it.)
- **Fix applied:** Updated to `0xf14` in `docs/01-hardware.md` and clarified the order semantics ("USB-MSD first").

### 2. CLAUDE.md preamble pointed at the pre-reorg comms path

- **Doc:** `CLAUDE.md:8,12`
- **Original claim:** Cross-cutting fixes flow via `docs/superpowers/progress/cross-claude-comms.md`. See `docs/superpowers/progress/2026-04-25-pi-repo-split.md` for the full split context.
- **Code reality:** Phase 1 of this audit moved both files to `docs/working/progress/`. The old paths no longer exist.
- **Fix applied:** Both paths updated to `docs/working/progress/...`. Added a pointer to `docs/README.md` for the new chapter index.

### 3. Cloudflared service description over-claimed a tunnel name

- **Doc:** `docs/02-services.md:11` (chapter draft)
- **Original claim:** Cloudflare tunnel `pi5-observatory` (UUID `bf725288-989b-4ae4-9d71-ea457310a8d4`) → `pi5.vivessato.com`
- **Code reality:** The tunnel UUID is correct (in `~/.cloudflared/config.yml`), but the human-readable name `pi5-observatory` only exists on the Cloudflare account dashboard — not anywhere in the repo or systemd unit. Per the skill's "Hallucination if not verifiable" rule, the name is unsupported.
- **Fix applied:** Dropped the name; rephrased to cite the UUID + the config file path.

## ❌ Hallucination (auto-fixed)

### 1. GUIDE.md — entirely the iMac Reference Guide

- **Doc:** `GUIDE.md` (whole file, 266 lines)
- **Original content:** "A real-time bird identification system running on a single iMac. Two cameras watch the yard …" — described iMac architecture top to bottom: CloudKey Gen 2+, Docker go2rtc, ten LaunchAgents (`com.vives.bird-{audio,capture,classifier,dashboard,enhanced-audio,health-monitor,livedetect,pipeline,rtsp-sync,tunnel}`), Coral USB, `venv-coral`/`venv` split, defunct `live_detector.py`, etc.
- **Code reality:** Pi-side has none of this. 4 systemd-user services (no LaunchAgents), native go2rtc binary (no Docker), one camera (no ground), Hailo-8L (no Coral), single venv, `bird_pipeline_v3.py` (not `bird_pipeline.py`), `pi_classifier.py` (not `classify.py --watch`), no `health_monitor.py`, no `refresh_rtsp.py`.
- **Fix applied:** Replaced the entire file with a chapter-index stub pointing at `docs/00-overview.md` through `docs/08-deployment.md`, the working/ deep-references, and the historical/ archive. 19 lines, all verifiable.

### 2. CLAUDE.md — Architecture / Services / Pipeline / Video sections

- **Doc:** `CLAUDE.md:41-68` (the four sections under `## Architecture`)
- **Original content:** "Single 2017 iMac (i5-7400, 8GB RAM). CloudKey Gen 2+ manages two UniFi cameras." Services table listed `audio_analyzer`, `enhanced_audio`, `cloudflared` as "tunnel: birds.vivessato.com" + an `rtsp-sync` cron — five wrong entries vs. the Pi-side reality. Detection Pipeline described `SmartClassifier (yard model on Coral TPU → AIY fallback)`.
- **Code reality:** Pi runs 4 systemd-user services + 1 timer; no audio services on Pi yet (placeholder); cloudflared maps `pi5.vivessato.com` (not `birds.vivessato.com`); no rtsp-sync cron (UNIFI_API_KEY is stable on Pi); pipeline uses `PiClassifier` (registry-based) with AIY ONNX on CPU as the active candidate, not `SmartClassifier`/yard/Coral.
- **Fix applied:** Replaced the whole `## Architecture` block with a Pi-accurate version: 4 services + timer, Pi-side detection pipeline (HailoDetector → BirdTracker → PiClassifier with vote-lock thresholds spelled out), Pi-side video path (WebRTC + SSE + CSS smoothing, with the rationale-vs-iMac pointer to `docs/05-dashboard.md`). Added explicit pointers to the new `docs/` chapters.

## 🐛 Smells

None this pass. The Pi-side code surface is recent (most of it written this session) and the dashboard code paths backing the audited claims read cleanly.

---

## ⏭ Skipped

None. Every chapter, root MD, and the working/* docs were inspected.

`cross-claude-comms.md` was deliberately not audited — append-only message bus, content is intentionally a chronological log of cross-Claude messages, not architectural claims.

The `historical/` tree was not audited (per the doc-audit brief: historical content gets a banner, not a re-verification pass).

---

## Cross-Claude note

iMac-Claude is doing a parallel audit on `/Users/vives/bird-classifier/` (their own repo, post-split). Their audit landed before this one (their `DOC_AUDIT.md` at the iMac repo root); the structures are intentionally similar but the Pi side opted for top-level chapters at `docs/00-08.md` plus `working/` and `historical/` as the brief from David specified — vs. iMac's `historical/` subfolders under each of `specs/`, `plans/`, `progress/`, `reviews/`.

Cross-cutting follow-ups (would belong on either side):

- The Pi-side cloudflared service ExecStart relies on `~/.cloudflared/config.yml` lookup-by-default rather than passing the tunnel UUID explicitly. Same on iMac side. Not a "smell" per skill rules (no doc claim hinges on it) — flagging here as a future-resilience note.
- The `historical/specs/2026-04-25-imac-live-classify-as-built.md` was authored by iMac-Claude pre-split and lives in BOTH repos. iMac-Claude may have updated their copy; my Pi-side copy is now historical and frozen. If David wants the as-built kept current, iMac-side is the canonical copy.
